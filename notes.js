used commands during the tutorial

$ npm init -y
//The command "npm init -y" initializes a new Node.js project with default settings, without prompting the user to answer any questions.

The "-y" flag stands for "yes," which means that it will automatically answer "yes" to all the prompts that would otherwise require user input. This is a convenient way to quickly create a new project with default settings without having to manually enter them.

Once executed, the command creates a package.json file in the current directory, which is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

$ npm i lodash
$ npm install normalize.css
